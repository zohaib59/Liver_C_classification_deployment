# Liver Disease Stage Prediction Web App

This is a Streamlit-based machine learning web app that predicts **liver disease stage** based on patient input features.
It uses an XGBoost model trained on a structured medical dataset and provides a clean, interactive UI for predictions, insights, and evaluation.

##  Features

- 📊 View dataset (with or without your own CSV)
- 🎯 Predict disease stage based on input data
- 📈 Evaluate model performance (accuracy, classification report)
- 🔄 Live deployment via Streamlit
- 🔐 Built-in sample data fallback if CSV is not available

Just Launched: Liver Disease Stage Prediction App (with Streamlit & XGBoost)!
Live Demo + GitHub + Full Code ✅

I built an interactive Streamlit web app to predict the stage of liver disease using machine learning.

✅ Highlights:

Uses a trained XGBoost model

Clean UI to view dataset, make predictions, and evaluate performance

Automatic handling of categorical/encoded data
